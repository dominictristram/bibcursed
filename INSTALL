INSTALLATION

Installation is simple...

  - If you are on a system with curses instead of ncurses edit the makefile
    and change CURSES to curses
  - Edit the makefile and change INSTDIR to your chosen binary installation
    directory. If you do not have root permissions, this must be somewhere
    you have write access, such as your home directory. Ideally this location
    would be in your PATH.
  - Change the MANDIR to point to your man page directory. Again, if you do
    not have root permissions this must be somewhere you can write to
  - type 'make' to compile
  - type 'make install' to install the binary and man page. This step is not
    strictly necessary, as you can just copy the files where you like
